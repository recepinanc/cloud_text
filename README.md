# CloudText

This gem removes punctuation and digits(optional), filters stopwords for the chosen language ('tr', 'en' or 'fr'), does stemming on the words and outputs an array of words with their frequencies.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cloud_text'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cloud_text

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cloud_text'

# Default options
# remove_digits => false
# language => "en"
# stemming => false

options = { remove_digits: false, language: "en", stemming: true }
cleaner = CloudText.clean_text("Your text to be cleaned, will come here1!1", options)
# => [["come", 1], ["will", 1], ["clean", 1], ["text", 1]]
